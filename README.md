# Project Idea
The idea behind the In Our City website forum is to be a resource for teachers to tell their stories from their classrooms. The hope is to be able to take the stories that help shed light on the inequalities between inner city and newly developed schools, and feature them on a front page of 'focus stories', where they will be the first stories readily available to those who view the page. 

# Project Background
In my prior work experience and thanks to the teachers I have spoken to so far, I have been able to notice many of the differences and inequalities present between inner city schools and schools which have been built in newly developed areas. The hope for this project is to share this information with the community and teachers of the Regina area, in hopes that support and exposure will be brought to these topics on inequality. 

# Business Opportunity
There are current available technologies and resources available online for teachers to access and utilize to tell their stories and vent their frustrations, but there is nothing focused and tailored to teachers in the Regina area. The business opportunity I see in this is that my website I plan to develop could be a resource readily available and given to teachers
